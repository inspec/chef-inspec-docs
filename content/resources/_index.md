Chef InSpec resources allow you to audit different applications and platforms.
InSpec has [core resources](core) that are bundled with InSpec and [resource packs](packs) that can be added as dependencies in a profile.
You can create a [custom resource](/profiles/custom_resources) to audit applications that aren't supported by the core resources or resource packs.
